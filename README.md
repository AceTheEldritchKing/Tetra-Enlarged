# Tetra-Enlarged
Adds larger versions of tetra's modular tools

Currently only the modular greatsword is implemented.

The  blade modules below are available for greatswords; if they were previously available for the normal modular sword, the schematic is now only on the greatsword.
- Heavy (Tetra)
- Odachi (T:E)
- Bastard (AoF)
- Flamberge (AoF)
- Executioner (AoF)
- Crucible (AoF)

The mod is designed to play with Better Combat by Daedelus, so the main distinction between greatswords and normal swords is the former requiring two hands.

Issues:
- Holosphere support is not yet implemented.
- No textures for serrated, tempered, and hooked improvements yet.

Planned Features:
Modular Polearms: 32x versions of single-headed tools. The halberd head will become exclusive to the modular polearm.
Tweaking module stats to further differentiate blades.
  
Possible Features:
- Twinblades: Functions like the modular double's left and right heads, but with up and down blades. 2 blades, hilt, 1 guard, fuller, no pommel. A twinblade weapon preset exists in Better Combat, there wouldn't be much twinblade-y about it without BC.
- Double-sided tools: One tool head at the top pointed left, one at the bottom pointed right, handle, socket. If the weapon was spinning, the heads would spin in the same direction
